|c|âAlvok|yeap
|c|âAlvok|gg
|c|âKendall Jenner|gg.
|c|âKendall Jenner|Can I have some advice\/opinions on my team?
|c|âKendall Jenner|I want to get over 1500 but I've been tilting hard.
|c|âAlvok|what's your spread\/moves on tflame? 
|c|âKendall Jenner|Sharp Beak. Will-O-Wisp, Brave Bird, Roost, and SD.
|c|âKendall Jenner|people tell me to flare blitz, but i find will-o-wisp to be very very useful.
|c|âAlvok|hmm it's either wisp\/taunt that'll be more useful than flare blitz actually
|c|âKendall Jenner|I agree!
|c|âAlvok|taunt helps to break heatran 
|c|âAlvok|but wisp is generally stronger
|c|âKendall Jenner|Definitely, definitely. I'm glad I finally found someone who agrees.
|c|âAlvok|haha :]
|c|âAlvok|err ... what moves do you have on greninja?
|c|âKendall Jenner|What do you think about AV Lando-T?
|c|âAlvok|hmm AV lando-T ? nahh
|c|âAlvok|the defensive or scarfed sets are better
|c|âKendall Jenner|For Greninja, I use Life Orb. Scald (More reliable than HP and chance of hax on Azu), Dark Pulse, Extrasensory, and Ice Beam. I used to run Taunt in there but I took it out for Extrasensory to hit Venusaur and etc.
|c|âKendall Jenner|Really? People tell me that but I find AV Lando-T baits Scarf which gives me an advantage when people mispredict it.
|c|âAlvok|hmm ice beam kills lati aft SR, dark pulse is not as needed in this meta
|c|âKendall Jenner|Taunt over DP?
|c|âKendall Jenner|Or HP Grass? etc.
|c|âAlvok|hmm you can actually try HP fire\/grass
|c|âAlvok|depending on which mons you wanna keep in check
|c|âKendall Jenner|Fire sounds good for Ferrothorns.
|c|âAlvok|yeah 
|c|âKendall Jenner|And Magnezones, etc.
|leave|Sugar K Leonard
|c|âAlvok|it's a good lure 
|c|âKendall Jenner|Should I really change the AV Set to a Scarf SR?
|c|âAlvok|err actually for your team i'll prefer the defensive set for lando-t
|c|âKendall Jenner|HP Grass works on other Greninjas. I always get hit by HP Grass when its Greninja vs Greninja.
|c|âAlvok|because you dont have a really reliable physical pivot
|c|âKendall Jenner|Defensive Set over AV, though?
|c|âKendall Jenner|That's true. I thought I never needed SR, because of Defog on Mew anyway.
|c|âAlvok|true but you need a defensive pivot on this team
|c|âAlvok|because your sweepers' all very frail
|c|âKendall Jenner|Lando-T has Intimidate and Max HP, does that count?
|c|âKendall Jenner|And yeah, you're definitely right.
|c|âAlvok|neutral nature or?
|c|âKendall Jenner|+ATK nature.
|c|âKendall Jenner|It hits Lati hard.
|c|âAlvok|hmm but with 0def investment apart from 252HP and a neutral nature on defense 
|c|âKendall Jenner|My team originally had major issues with Mega Manectric, that's why I threw in Mew in the mix. Do you think Stallbreaker Mew works with my team ok?
|c|âAlvok|only allows you to take 2 hits from m.pinsir\/m.hera
|c|âKendall Jenner|Yeah, that's true.
|c|âAlvok|i love stallbreaking mew actually :]
|c|âAlvok|it's the mon i used to win my first tourney
|c|âKendall Jenner|I love it too. It can be bulky.
|c|âKendall Jenner|Nice, nice.
|c|âKendall Jenner|Will-O-Wisp + Softboiled\/Roost for Mew and Talon allows them to stall very well.
|c|âKendall Jenner|I like Will-O-Wisp on Talon because it allows me to setup SR while Roosting and it damages the opponent while setting up.
|c|âAlvok|yeah , stallbreaking mew's threatening
|c|âAlvok|as there's more and more m.hera
|c|âKendall Jenner|Definitely.
|c|âAlvok|and clefables
|c|âKendall Jenner|What does my team look weak against?
|c|âAlvok|i think it's weak to sand HO 
|c|âKendall Jenner|I feel like it can handle everything pretty well-balanced so long as I'm playing good and there's no hax.
|c|âKendall Jenner|Sand HO?
|c|âKendall Jenner|What's HO.
|c|âAlvok|hyper offense
|c|âKendall Jenner|Like Hippowdon?
|c|âAlvok|generally life orb excadrill with sandrush
|c|âAlvok|with ttar that packs icebeam and fire blast
|c|âKendall Jenner|Yeah, I can handle those teams but it usually involves me sacrificing 2 Pokemon to stall for Sandstream to run out.
|c|âKendall Jenner|Not good.
|c|âAlvok|yeah which is very risky
|c|âKendall Jenner|What can help me counter Sand HO?
|c|âKendall Jenner|Sandrush Exca is hard.
|c|âKendall Jenner|2KOs Lando-T if I switch in.
|c|âKendall Jenner|1 KO if I switch in* 2OHKO if I don't.
|c|âKendall Jenner|Which is fine, 1 EQ gets rid of Exca usually.
|c|âAlvok|usually i use either ferro, lando-t + clefable to play around sand offense
|c|âKendall Jenner|True, true.
|c|âAlvok|throw in clef on ttar to bait in exca and play around between ferro and lando-t
|c|âAlvok|to weaken it
|c|âKendall Jenner|I think I might end up dumping this team altogether. It's very unorthodox and I don't think it can compete well when I get higher and higher.
|c|âKendall Jenner|I'll probably run something similar to Disorient's team or something that's more well-balanced than mine.
|c|âAlvok|trying building a balanced team instead of leaning towards 1 spectrum such as HO or stall
|c|âAlvok|because only balanced teams allow you to face opposing HO\/stall
|c|âKendall Jenner|I got 2 Special Sweepers, 2 Physical Sweepers, and 2 decent Tankers. Isn't that ok?
|c|âKendall Jenner|3 Physical Sweepers if you count one of the tanks.
|c|âKendall Jenner|Lando-T.
|c|âAlvok|but your lando-t lacks recovery
|c|âAlvok|and life orb thundurus and greninja get worn out very quickly
|c|âAlvok|if it comes to a stall game
|c|âKendall Jenner|Right, right.
|c|âKendall Jenner|Damn. I need to reevaluate my choices.

|c|âKendall Jenner|Alright, man. Thanks for taking your time to talk to me.

|c|âAlvok|what should be killed from a fireblast is most probably killed from a flamethrower too so i dont see the point in risking the accuracy

|c|âKendall Jenner|Exactly, unless you're facing pokes that take neutral damage or resist.
|c|âKendall Jenner|and you're gonna sack.
|c|âAlvok|yeah
|c|âKendall Jenner|I'm guessing that's the reason people use Fire Blast.
|c|âKendall Jenner|they want to get as much damage in as possible.
|c|âKendall Jenner|so the next poke can revenge.
