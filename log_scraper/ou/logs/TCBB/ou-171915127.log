|win|trinitrotoluene
|c|âtrinitrotoluene|gg.
|c|âtrinitrotoluene|now, analysis.
|c|âTCBB|gg
|c|âTCBB|of team preview?
|c|âtrinitrotoluene|yea. we're doing this analysis one turn at a time.
|c|âtrinitrotoluene|give me your thoughts during each turn and i'll give you mine.
|join|Exeggutor
|c|âTCBB|team preview i see that i have nothing to switch into azumarill but i have rotom-w to check it
|c|âTCBB|and kyurem as well
|c|âTCBB|azelf is mostly likely to be lead azelf since its actuallt the only thing on the team with stealth rocks
|c|âTCBB|i see no mega on your team but gyarados seems to be the only thing that can mega evo
|c|âTCBB|haxorus is obviously a wallbreaker 
|c|âTCBB|although theres a azu and cube on your team they both can be wallbreakers so i can't exactly tell which is which
|c|âTCBB|starmie is a spinner to support gyara and cube
|c|âtrinitrotoluene|so, it was p. obvious what my lead was, huh?
|c|âTCBB|yeah
|c|âTCBB|my checks are mega gyara are cube if no stone edge and maybe azu
|c|âTCBB|i probably should have tried to play better with them tbh
|leave|Exeggutor
|c|âtrinitrotoluene|ok.
|c|âTCBB|i don't also see a set up chance for zard
|c|âTCBB|X_X
|c|âtrinitrotoluene|my turn for team preview analysis.
|c|âtrinitrotoluene|so, looking at your team, i quickly came to the conclusion that either mamo or drill carried rocks.
|c|âtrinitrotoluene|however, because of the notable lack of potential scarfers (besides cube and ~~lol scarfzard~~), i had a good reason to assume drill was scarfed.
|c|âtrinitrotoluene|also, because you had a zard, it was reasonable to assume that cube would be a breaker that would open up the zard sweep.
|c|âtrinitrotoluene|azu and rotom-w looked like potential pivots (rotom-w moreso than azu), so i had to keep in mind that they wouldn't hit as hard as they normally would.
|c|âtrinitrotoluene|since i was assuming one of drill or cube was scarfed, i thoght of making megados my primary win condition for this battle.
|c|âtrinitrotoluene|*thought
|c|âtrinitrotoluene|i could set up on one wrong move and then potentially sweep your team clean.
|c|âtrinitrotoluene|now that i had those thoughts out, i chose to lead w\/ azelf because quick n ez rocks are fun.
|c|âtrinitrotoluene|this would then help me set the battle stage for a megados sweep, which is always handy.
|c|âtrinitrotoluene|since my cube was the av pivot seen in stathakis' rmt, i knew i needed to keep it healthy to keep your azu in check.
|c|âtrinitrotoluene|and yea, certain obvious roles (e.g. drill is spinner, zard is sweeper) are obvious.
|c|âtrinitrotoluene|now, turn 1 analysis.
|c|âtrinitrotoluene|go.
