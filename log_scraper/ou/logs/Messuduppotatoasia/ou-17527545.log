|chat|Flame_Blader1|special variant with rock slide?
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|it had 156 SpA EVs
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|and Fire Blast
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|which will guarantee an OHKO on Scizor
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|and with Magnezone
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|many players won't choose to use BP
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|so I can usually just start off the match without Scizor, 6-5
|chat|Flame_Blader1|just for scizor eh
|chat|Flame_Blader1|kk
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|85% of the time
|chat|Flame_Blader1|fire blast hits

|chat|Flame_Blader1|u better win the final now
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|okay xDD
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|sorry about that critical
|chat|Flame_Blader1|no worries lol
|chat|Flame_Blader1|it happens
|chat|Flame_Blader1|stone edge gets no crits in 3 moves but FB does
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|seems to happen a lot with that Hydreigon
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|Stone Edge no miss in 3 moves
|chat|Flame_Blader1|how convenient xD
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|Hydreigon crits a lot for some reason
|chat|Flame_Blader1|must be the lucky star effect xD
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|I once took out like 3 members of an opponents team by critical hit Dracos
|chat|Flame_Blader1|lolol
|chat|Flame_Blader1|yeah I was haxing a lot with my other teams a few days ago too
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|and I thought you faced Alpha and knew about mixDreigon
|chat|Flame_Blader1|should have just used those to get some cheap wins
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|so I didn't htink you'd stay in with Heatran lol
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|that nub team?
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|Scizor, Rotom-W, Celebi, Heatran, Terrakion, and something else?
|chat|Flame_Blader1|I still haven't gotten use to every single set as I was in gen 4 soo yeh
|chat|Flame_Blader1|this is the same team lol
|chat|Flame_Blader1|I took terrakion out for hera
|chat|Flame_Blader1|just before this
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|I thought Heracross was going to be Scarfed...
|chat|Flame_Blader1|I had something else planned for it but I lost Latios early
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|fast Fighters and Dragons are pretty threatening to this team
|chat|Flame_Blader1|if only celebi was still there I might have been able to play around it and gengar
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|my thought process was just to try and set up with Latias
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|on Celebi
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|kinda tried to sac Hydreigon but didn't work out that way :|
|chat|Flame_Blader1|u know I had T-wave right?
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|Substitute
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|Calm Mind
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|Roost
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|Dragon Pulse
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|is what I run for my Latias on this team
|chat|Flame_Blader1|I guess it all depends on prediction
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|originally had it so I had at least something to combat SubProtect Gliscor, but turned out to be a really good member
|chat|Flame_Blader1|were u planning on switch at all or were u gonna keep hydregion in until it died?
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|kinda depended on what you were going to do lol
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|and how much Fire Blast did
|chat|Flame_Blader1|assuming it didn't do much?
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|probably would have just used Fire Blast\/Draco until it died
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|though
|chat|Flame_Blader1|I guess its all speculation at this point
|chat|Flame_Blader1|would u have sent in latios right away?
|chat|Flame_Blader1|or terrakion?
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|I don't know lol
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|I probably would have sent in Latias once I knew what you were planning to do on Hydreigon
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|because what people do to Hydreigon is pretty similar to what they do on Latias
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|so Hydreigon was more of a testing dummy
|chat|Flame_Blader1|there wasn't much for me to do apart from wait for para hax\/stall with recover
|chat|Flame_Blader1|possibly I could have used U-turn to finish it off if it was within touching distance
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|ah, then things would have been different
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|I don't know what would have happened then xD
|chat|Flame_Blader1|k anyways
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|well another thought on my mind was using Bullet Punch on Scizor to sweep once Rotom-W was weakneed
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|anyways wut?
|chat|Flame_Blader1|nothing just saying
|chat|Flame_Blader1|it doesn't look like u changed much of ur team though from last time
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|whaaa
|chat|Flame_Blader1|u always seem to have scizor and terrakion on ur team no matter what lol
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|what was it last time?
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|:|
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|I'm pretty sure
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|I have teams
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|that don't
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|have either
|chat|Flame_Blader1|LIEZ
|chat|Flame_Blader1|I know for sure u have at least scizor on every team
|chat|Flame_Blader1|xD
|chat|Flame_Blader1|inb4excuses!
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|well none of my other teams are any good anymore
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|I tried them
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|they weren't winning games
|chat|Flame_Blader1|like?
|chat|Flame_Blader1|idk why but latios seems kinda meh to me
|chat|Flame_Blader1|I guess I just can't use it properly lol
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|Tyranitar, Stoutland, Magnezone, Scizor, Latios, Landorus team
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|Breloom ruins it
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|Breloom ruined everything
|chat|Flame_Blader1|lolol
|chat|Flame_Blader1|yeah spore is a bitch
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|Genesect wasn't all that much better either
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|but it's banned now
|chat|Flame_Blader1|especially with the new sleep condition
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|freaking Tornadus-T, it's banned too but still
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|how 'bout them Landorus-T, just pooping over every team I make
|chat|Flame_Blader1|Landorus T is annoying I agree
|chat|Flame_Blader1|just pop up and start U-turning
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|but in reality, it's no bulkier than regular Landorus lol
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|just slower but more powerful
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|well it has Intimidate
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|but other than that
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|just a slower and more powerful Landorus
|chat|Messuduppotatoasia|still, this team doesn't take Earthquakes very well
|chat|Flame_Blader1|lets get of showdown lo
|chat|Flame_Blader1|talk on skype xD
