|c| DrReuniclus3|The question is, why did he even stay in
|c|âBro Battington|idk
|c|âBro Battington|I'm surprised this team is 14-3
|c|âBro Battington|Even though the 3 battles I lost were all back to back
|c| DrReuniclus3|What problems has it had?

|c|âBro Battington|Like one was me playing poorly and getting pooed on by a Toxicroak
|c|âBro Battington|Lategame
|c|âBro Battington|The other two were due to Lopunny
|c|âBro Battington|Just taking a big one
|c| DrReuniclus3|o
|c|âBro Battington|And I can't like...priority it to death cause it's immune to Shadow Sneak
|c|âBro Battington|The first loss though, this dude was making reckless plays but he was still outplaying me
|c|âBro Battington|Like I had Gallade in on his Rade and he went for Sleep Powder
|c|âBro Battington|I SD'd thinking it was peachy
|c| DrReuniclus3|Was it mega yet?
|c|âBro Battington|Yeah
|c| DrReuniclus3|oh
|c| DrReuniclus3|Or it could have been he had no idea what he was doing
|c|âBro Battington|Nah he had an idea
|c|âBro Battington|It's just that like...I was predicting way outfield on him and he was...infield
|c| DrReuniclus3|But still 14-3 isn't bad
|c|âBro Battington|yeee
